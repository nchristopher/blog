I've read a few tutorials on the subject, but none of them have been able to _actually_ tell me how to enable dark mode on chromeOS. **Here's what I've pieced together**.

# Switch to the beta channel

The option to enable dark mode is only available on the **beta** channel of chromeOS. I haven't had any issues with switching, but just know the beta channel is probably less stable than normal. Here's how to switch:

-   Open the **Settings** app on chromeOS.
-   Navigate to **About Chrome OS**, then click **Additional details**.
-   Click the **Change channel** button, then select **Beta**.

Your chromebook will begin downloading an update. When it's finished, it'll have you restart. Congratulations - you completed the hard part.

# Unlocking dark mode

The dark mode option is locked behind a feature flag, so you'll have to enable it.

-   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://flags`, then search for "dark".
-   From the list, switch **Dark/light mode of system UI** and **WebUI dark mode** to `enabled`.

-   Restart your chromebook to apply the changes.

You're almost there!

# Enabling it

Now that the option is available, you just have to switch it on!

-   Open the **Settings** app.
-   Navigate to **Personalization**, then click **Dark mode**.
-   Switch the option on!

There you have it, dark mode on chromeOS!
