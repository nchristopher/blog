The dark mode option is locked behind a feature flag, so you'll have to enable it.

-   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://flags`, then search for "dark".
-   From the list, switch **Dark/light mode of system UI** and **WebUI dark mode** to `enabled`.

-   Restart your chromebook to apply the changes.

Now that the option is available, you just have to switch it on!

-   Open the **Settings** app.
-   Navigate to **Personalization**, then click **Dark mode**.
-   Switch the option on!
